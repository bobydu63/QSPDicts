## QSPDicts

A repository for qsptools-compatible XML dictionaries.

In order to for this repository to be easily navigated and maintained, any submitted files should   
follow the below folder structure.

Translation cleanup should happen in-place and not spawn duplicates, so make sure you sync your files  
before making further changes.

##### TODO:
Find a way/script to easily merge previously cleaned or corrected translation files with new translation files  
so changes are preserved.
